# Puzzle ‚ôü Chess

A simple chess game where you solve puzzles.

## üíª Technology

Built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ü™∂ Philosophy

I try to write code that beginners can understand. Keep everything simple. Avoid being overly complex or caring too much about optimization.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Details

- players **start at a rating of 400** when starting a new game
- solving or failing a puzzle will change the player rating
  - up to a **maximum of +/- 32**, based on the puzzle difficulty
- player rating is stored via [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) 
- puzzles are selected **randomly** from within **+/- 100** the player rating
- in order to support **offline play**, approximately ~2 MB of puzzles
  - stored in `/puzzles/offline/puzzles.csv`
  - range in difficulty from **400 to 3166**
  - puzzles were selected from [Lichess Open Database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles)
- in a future update, support for the **[Lichess.org API](https://lichess.org/api)** is planned
  - this will enable use of the entire puzzle database
- [pawn promotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)) is supported
  - but the piece will be automatically chosen based on the puzzle solution
- the **current player rating** is visible in the **‚ò∞ menu**
- double clicking the **Puzzle ‚ôü Chess** title will reveal a **debug information**
